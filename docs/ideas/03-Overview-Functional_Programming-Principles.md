# Overview Functional Programming Principles

- Maybe - For handling optional values.
- IO - For side-effecting computations.
- Either - For computations that can result in success or failure.
- Reader – For environment-based dependency injection.
- State – For modeling stateful computations.
- Writer – For accumulating logs or outputs alongside a computation.
- Monoid – For combining values with a binary operation and identity element.
- Async – For modeling asynchronous computations functionally.
- Option – A simpler version of Maybe, for representing optional values.
- Tuple (or Pair) – For returning multiple related values.
- Result
